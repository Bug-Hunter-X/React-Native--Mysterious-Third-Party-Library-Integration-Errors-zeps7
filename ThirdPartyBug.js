This error occurs when using a third-party library that hasn't been properly integrated with React Native's environment. It might be due to incorrect installation, missing dependencies, or incompatibility between the library and your project's setup.  The error message itself is usually not very specific, making it hard to pinpoint the exact cause.  Often, you'll see something general like `Invariant Violation` or a message about a missing module or method.
